## 🧠 Overview  

**Wallhack** is a visual optimization mod for **Fortnite** focused on improving interface contrast and overall screen clarity. By adjusting color balance, brightness separation, and UI contrast, the mod helps important elements stand out more clearly during fast-paced gameplay.

In addition to interface refinements, Wallone applies lightweight visual optimizations that can reduce unnecessary on-screen effects. This can result in smoother performance on some systems, making motion clearer and helping players better track opponents during intense moments.

Wallhack does not change weapons, damage, or core mechanics. Its goal is to enhance how the game looks and feels visually, allowing players to focus more easily on movement, positioning, and situational awareness.
